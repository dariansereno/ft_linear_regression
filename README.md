# ft_linear_regression

This project, **ft_linear_regression**, is a 42 school project aimed at teaching linear regression. The dataset contains the price of a car as a function of its mileage. The goal is to implement a gradient descent algorithm to train the linear regression model. To evaluate the performance of the model, mean squared error (MSE) is used to measure the loss, and R2 score is used to assess the precision.

## Installation
